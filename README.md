# A Tech Blog
The front end of the blog is a React app that uses the Spring Boot back end. The blog has a clean, modern design that is easy to navigate. The front end of the blog is very fast and responsive. The back end of the blog is very reliable and provides a great user experience.

## How to run
Right now we have not deployed this app onto any proper server so it needs to be run locally, first cd into the client side and run npm i then npm start
then finally move to the server side and launch the TechBlogApplication file to start the server.
